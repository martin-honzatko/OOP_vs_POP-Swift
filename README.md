<!--**Design for example projects:**  
1. object Library  
   - private set variable name  
   - private set variable array of books  
   - private set variable array of spaces  
   - initializer taking name, array of books, array of spaces  
   - initializer taking name, one book, one space  
   - description = name + book count + space count  
   - method to add book  
   - method to add space  
   - method to remove book  
   - method to remove space  
   - method show books/spaces - print array in alphabetical order  
   - implement Equatable and Comparable - compare by book count and space count (the more spaces the bigger)  
2. object Book  
   - private set variable title  
   - private set variable author  
   - private set variable year of publication  
   - private set variable genre  
   - initializer taking all Book properties  
   - description = Title: ; Author: ; Year of publication: ; Genre: ;  
   - implement Equatable and Comparable  
3. object Ebook: Book  
   - ...  
   - private set variable size  
   - initializer taking all Book properties + size  
   - description = ... Size: ;  
4. object Space  
   - private set variable name  
   - private set variable description of space  
   - initializer taking all Space properties  
   - description  
   - implement Equatable and Comparable  
5. object InternetRoom: Space  
   - ...  
   - private set variable number of computers  
   - initializer taking all Space properties + number of computers  
   - description  
   - method add computer  
6. object Reading room: Space 
   - ...
